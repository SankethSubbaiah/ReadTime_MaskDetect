# ReadTime_MaskDetect
Overview:
This project aims to detect masks on real-time videos or images using deep learning and OpenCV. The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces and classify them as either wearing a mask or not. OpenCV is used to capture the frames of a video or an image and to detect the faces in it. The pre-trained model is then used to identify the mask or no-mask status of the faces present in the image or video.

Step by Step Procedure:
1. Install the necessary packages and libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow.

2. Download a pre-trained deep learning model for face detection and mask classification.

3. Use OpenCV to capture frames from the video or image.

4. Use the pre-trained model to detect faces in the captured frame.

5. For each face detected, use the pre-trained model to classify it as wearing a mask or not.

6. Output the results of the mask detection for the frame.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each frame in the video or image.

8. Show the final output of the mask detection on the video or image.
